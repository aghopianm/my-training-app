      <h2>Welcome to My Fitness App</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this app is to provide a beginner friendly, and transparent guide to
        your fitness goals. I know first hand how hard it is to get involved in fitness, having 
        gone from supper skinny to in shape, to very overweight to back in shape, I have experience
        with coaching individuals of all shapes and sizes. No matter what, remember that by
        taking the leap into fitness, you have taken the most important step - believing in yourself!
